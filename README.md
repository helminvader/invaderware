# invaderware
invaderware is a lil project of mine to get rid of boredom

"invaderware" is a scripthub that consists of multiple tabs for specified games to exploit in. for example ( arsenal and mm2 )
every script i made and published in this github repository will be in the scripthub. ( includes unreleased scripts )
some scripts included in this scripthub are not made by me. ( some are )
- invaderware is also the name i chose to create this repository -
but this repository only focuses on the scripts i make myself instead of the scripthub i mentioned

the scripthub itself has a whitelist so add me on discord if you are interested "@observehere"
im also looking for people to showcase both the script hub and the scripts i made so js lmk yfm
