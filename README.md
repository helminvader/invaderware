# invaderware
scripthub or scripts in general

invaderware is a lil project of mine to get rid of boredom

invaderware is a scripthub that consists of multiple tabs for specified games to exploit in. for example ( arsenal and mm2 )
some scripts included in this scripthub are not made by me. ( some are )

the scripthub itself has a whitelist so add me on discord if you are interested "@observehere"
but this repository only focusses on the scripts i make myself instead of the scripthub i mentioned
